📄 Project Description
Flappy Bird is a fun and interactive side-scrolling game developed by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player controls a bird that flies through gaps between pipes by clicking or pressing a key. This project showcases my skills in game development, DOM manipulation, and responsive UI design.

- Keyboard/mouse controls
- Real-time collision detection
- Score tracking
- Game over and restart functionality
